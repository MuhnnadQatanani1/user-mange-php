# User Management System

A PHP-based User Management System that provides separate dashboards for administrators and regular users. Administrators can manage users, while users can view their profiles.

## Features

### Admin Dashboard
- View all **users** and **your own profile** (admins cannot see other admins).
- Add new **users** and **admins**.
- Edit user details.
- Delete users.
- Reset user passwords.

### User Dashboard
- View your own profile.

### Authentication
- Secure **login** and **logout** system with session handling.
- Role-based access control (admin vs. user).



### Prerequisites
- PHP (7.4 or higher)
- MySQL
- Web server (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, or similar)

## Notes
* Ensure the uploads/ directory is writable (chmod 777 on Linux systems) for profile picture uploads.
* Use secure passwords for admin accounts.
* Sessions automatically expire on logout or inactivity.
